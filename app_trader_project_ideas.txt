Things we care about the most:

Rating - App longevity

Price - How much App Trader will pay for app rights

Number of reviews

Is it in both stores?



Specific things to care about for more in-depth lists:

Content rating

Install count on play store (for play store apps)

Getting insights on "size" and how it relates to other data points


Questions we can answer:

Make a SQL query for these questions - 

Rating - How many apps are over 3 stars?

Price - How many apps are free? Cost money? What's the avg cost of apps that require payment? Mode of cost for apps that need a payment?

Number of reviews - How many reviews do we need? Is there a certain amount we require to even consider a recommendation?

For play store - Whats the genre breakdown for the categories?



Ask ourselves if - 

Does it being in both stores actually matter? Why or why not? When should we consider this point?

Does content rating matter? Do certain content ratings have more apps? Higher star rating? What types of apps are in these content ratings?

Which content rating has the most free apps? Most paid apps? 

On the play store, which content rating gets the most installs?

Does install count affect review count? Do higher rated apps have more reviews? Do higher rated apps have more install count?
